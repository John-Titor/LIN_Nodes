How things work in this sourcebase.

Prefer building at the top level, to get all depdenencies built correctly. Use 'build' and 'clean'.

Use the 'program' toplevel target when a probe is attached to reprogram all nodes on the network.

'lintool' prints lots of help; 'lintool update' is how to flash things.

'mkfw' generates a firmware bundle for the usb_link updater.py script.


PowerV3 programming (THIS IS A BUG - address needs to be preserved either by programmer or firmware...)
-------------------
After a program / reset-to-defaults, the PowerV3 comes up at address 16, it needs to be reset to something sane with:

  build/lintool/lintool param -n 16 NodeIndex <INDEX>

where INDEX is the unit index in the range 1-14 inclusive.
