How things work in this sourcebase.

Prefer building at the top level, to get all depdenencies built correctly. Use 'build' and 'clean'.

Use the 'program' toplevel target when a probe is attached to reprogram all nodes on the network.

'lintool' prints lots of help; 'lintool update' is how to flash things.

'mkfw' generates a firmware bundle for the usb_link updater.py script.
